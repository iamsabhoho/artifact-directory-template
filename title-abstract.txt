Title:
<CoCoDroid: Detecting Malware By Building Common Graph Using Control Flow Graph>

Abstract:
<In today's world, malware has grown so much. In 2020, there are more than 129 millions of Android users around the world. With Android applications dominating the devices, we hope to produce a detection tool that is accessible to the general public. We present a structure that analyze apps in the form of control flow graph. With that, we build a common graph to capture how close the apps are to each other and classify whether they are malicious or not. We compare our work with other methods and show that using control flow graph is a good choice as a representation of APKs and can outperform other models. We built features using Metapath2Vec and Doc2Vec, and trained Random Forest, 1-Nearest Neighbors, and 3-Nearest Neighbors Models.>
